Mechanical Inventory App

A vision-based mechanical spare parts identification and inventory management system built with Flask, MySQL, and a trained Faster R-CNN model.
The application detects mechanical parts in uploaded images, updates their quantities in a live database, and provides a simple dashboard to view inventory levels.


Features

Automated Detection: Upload an image to detect and classify mechanical parts such as bolts, nuts, bearings, and gears.
Database Synchronization: Detected part counts are automatically updated in the MySQL inventory database.
